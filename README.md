# What does our solution do?
SnakeAid is an AI-powered bot that helps with:

- Fast Stabilization & Transport: Guides immediate first aid actions to get victims to medical care quickly.
- Right Decisions Matter: Prevents mistakes, reducing risk of severe complications and therefore likelihood of disability or death.
- Lowers technical access barriers: Delivers lifesaving guidance in remote areas without the need of smartphones or internet.
- Innovation: Unlike existing first-aid websites or static databases, SnakeAid is instant, interactive, and accessible offline via WhatsApp. No current WhatsApp-based AI snakebite assistant exists for rural users. - Google Search is unreliable, and health apps require stable internet & large downloads.

# How It Works (Technical Flow)
- User sends a message via WhatsApp describing a snakebite incident.
- The bot asks guided questions to extract key details (symptoms, location of snake).
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) matches the description against the database.
- The bot provides first-aid steps to decrease risk of harmful aid.
- It can also analyse snake pictures and reply with species information and first aid tips.
